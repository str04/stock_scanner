### 1. **Daily Stock Return Scanner (FastAPI)**

#### Why Use This?
- **Market Stagnation Analysis**: This tool helps identify stocks that have shown **0% returns over a customizable time frame** (e.g., 7 years by default). Such stocks might be potential targets for value investors looking for undervalued opportunities or for identifying companies that may be struggling.
- **Customizable Parameters**: It offers flexibility in terms of setting the desired return threshold and the number of years for analysis. This makes it suitable for a wide range of investing strategies, from value investing to growth stock hunting.
- **Automated Daily Scans**: The scanner runs automatically at the end of each market day and saves the results, making it efficient for long-term data tracking and pattern identification.

#### How It Helps You:
- **Market Insights**: Analysts can use this scanner to **track stocks that have remained flat** over the years, potentially indicating either stability or lack of growth.
- **Pre-filtering Stocks**: Investors can use this as a preliminary screening tool to filter out stocks from a larger pool (S&P 500, NIFTY 50, SENSEX) based on return criteria, saving time in manual analysis.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: By providing historical performance, the tool allows traders to make data-backed investment decisions, focusing on stocks that have been stagnant but may show potential for recovery or growth.

### 2. **Lifetime High Stock Scanner (Streamlit)**

#### Why Use This?
- **Momentum Trading Insights**: This tool helps identify **stocks that have reached a lifetime high, used it as a support level, and appreciated afterward**. Stocks that hold strong at previous highs often indicate strong investor confidence and are seen as potential breakout candidates.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: The user can define the appreciation percentage threshold, allowing for flexibility based on their specific trading strategy.
- **Historical Opportunity Tracking**: Analyzing stock behavior over the past 10 years, the scanner provides historical data on how often these patterns occurred and how successful they were. It offers annual summaries that help traders spot trends in market cycles.

#### How It Helps You:
- **Breakout and Support Strategy**: For technical traders, this scanner helps **spot potential breakout stocks** that have held their highs as support levels, giving signals for possible future upward trends.
- **Opportunity Identification**: It helps investors identify **historically strong stocks**, where confidence has held at new highs, and those stocks that experience significant appreciation afterward. This could be particularly useful for momentum investors or swing traders.
- **Comprehensive Insights**: By summarizing past opportunities and calculating success rates, it provides actionable insights for planning future trades and understanding market behavior over time.

### How It Can Benefit You Overall:

1. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Both scanners provide structured data on stock performance, helping traders make informed decisions rather than relying solely on market news or speculation.
2. **Customizable Analysis**: You can tweak parameters (return percentages, time frames, appreciation thresholds) to suit your personal investment strategy.
3. **Automation and Efficiency**: The tools automate stock screening and analysis, saving you time in manually analyzing data while ensuring that important patterns and opportunities aren't missed.
4. **Historical Insights**: Both scanners allow you to understand historical performance, making it easier to predict future patterns or trends.
5. **Multiple Indices**: By scanning across major indices (S&P 500, NIFTY 50, BSE SENSEX), you can diversify your analysis across global markets.
